# Machine Learning System
I would like to stress a few important components of building a machine learning system, including selection of correct machine learning model, automated testing, deployment of machine learning model, etc.
For each component, I would like to first discuss the importance (why) of it, existing methodologies, and solving a real-world problem using a Jupyter Notebook example.  

The organization of demonstrating of each component is as following ...
- Selection of the correct machine learning model
- Automated Testing
  - methodology
  - example
